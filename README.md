# Article Mapping

## About

An easy-to-use librairy to map the most used words and the strongest pairs of words in a text document.
This document can be **online or local**, you can access it via an URL or a file path.

## Install

After downloading the repo, you only have to add the libraires to your project. These librairies can be found in the *lib* folder.

If you want to download them by yourself, here are the librairies required for this project :

- jgraphx
- jsoup (1.13.1)
- jgrapht-core (1.4.0 - Maven)
- jgrapht-ext (1.4.0 - Maven)

I recommend these versions because I coded with them. I don't recommend trying this project with other versions but feel free to test it :)

*Note : I used JDK 13 to code this project so I recommend using it if you want to make modifications.*

## Testing

To test if your installation is working, try to launch the **vue.Main** and the **vue.graph.MainGraph** classes with the `-e` option.

This option is used to display a sample test with both a file and an URL (a Wikipedia article).

Simply us the --help / -h option on **vue.Main**  or **vue.graph.MainGraph** to get some help on how to use this librairy.

## Contributing

This is a personnal project but if you wish to contribute, please try to respect the following  coding style :

- clearly indented code
- space between methods
- class and method javadoc for everything important (no need for small methods)
- comments when **necessary**

To resume : clean and documented code, not overflowed by comments but still comprehensible.

I accept anything enhancing the project. Issues and PR will be checked ASAP (1 day ~)

## Credits

Almost everything written in this projects is from my own hand exept for the SortingMap class.
